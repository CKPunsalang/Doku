# Doku
CSUCI Capstone project (Comp 491 Spring 2024 - Comp 499 Fall 2024)

Idea and project by: Calla Punsalang

Overseeing this project: Dr. Jason Isaacs CSUCI

## What is Doku?
Doku is a sudoku app with a twist. It aims to make a traditional game more approachable to a wider range of audiences.

## Where is Doku currently?
(11/02/24)

Doku has progressed so much from it's conception. Here are the features currently available

- A main menu where a player can initiate a game of sudoku
- A difficulty selection screen where players can choose from easy, medium, or hard
- Puzzles are auto generated for the player
- Players can select their desired number from the number buttons at the bottom of the screen and place them onto the grey bubbles in the puzzle
    - Numbers that are placed by the player are in **bold**, generated numbers are not
- Once a player has placed the maxumum amount of numbers (9), the button becomes inactive and they can no longer fill in for that number
- To undo a number placement, players simply press the placed number again
- There is also a light and dark mode for the player to enjoy

## What's next for Doku?
I'd like to implement these features next:

- Have a visual indication of what number the player is currently filling in
- Have a visual indication whether the number the player has placed is correct or not

# Doku
CSUCI Capstone project (Comp 491 Spring 2024 - Comp 499 Fall 2024)

Idea and project by: Calla Punsalang

Overseeing this project: Dr. Jason Isaacs CSUCI

## What is Doku?
Doku is a sudoku app with a twist. It aims to make a traditional puzzle more approachable to a wider range of audiences.

## Where is Doku currently?
(12/05/24)

Doku has progressed so much from it's conception. Here are the features currently available.

- A main menu where a player can initiate a game of sudoku.
- A difficulty selection screen where players can choose from easy, medium, hard, or expert.
- Players can choose whether they would like numbered bubbles or numberless bubbles.
- Puzzles are auto generated for the player.
- Players can select their desired number from the number buttons at the bottom of the screen and place them onto the grey bubbles in the puzzle.
    - Numbers that are placed by the player are in **bold**, generated numbers are not.
- Once a player has placed the maxumum amount of numbers (9), the button becomes inactive and they can no longer fill in for that number.
- Players have a visual indication of what number they are currently filling in.
- To undo a number placement, players simply press the placed number again.
- There is also a light and dark mode for the player to enjoy.

## What's next for Doku?
I'd like to implement these features next:

- Move the number/numberless selection to a settings screen.
- Implement more settings for the player to allow for more customization.

## How to run Doku
Doku is written entirely in Swift.

With this, since it is an iOS application. The following is needed in order to further develop Doku:
- A device that runs macOS (Macbook, iMac, etc.)
- Xcode
- (Optional) A device to be used as an emulator

For the dependencies and packages needed, the ones that are needed will be downloaded and installed during the initial Xcode installation. You'll be asked to download dependencies/packages for emulators to run within Xcode as well. Doku has been initially developed for iPhones, but future development for other Apple devices has been considered. 

All the code and assets needed for Doku are in this repository. So simply download the main branch and open the project in Xcode.

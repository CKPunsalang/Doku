My name is Calla Punsalang (pronounced call-uh)! I am (about to be) a recent graduate from CSU Channel Islands with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I also have an Associate of Arts in Liberal Arts with an emphasis on Science, Mathematics, and Engineering from DeAnza College. 

I've encountered and coded in multiple languages throughout my years at DeAnza and CSUCI, including Python, Swift, C, KQL, and many more. My most recent project as been [Doku]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link doku.md %}){: .custom-link} which is a iOS mobile app that puts a visual twist on traditional Sudoku and makes it easier for beginners to pick up. I absolutely loved not only diving into creating my puzzle generating algorithm, but also working to create a UI that would be more approachable! 

I am currently employed as a Student Assistant Level II for Information Security at CSU Channel Islands. I've helped with creating and deploying payloads for phishing simulations, created KQL queries for our Microsoft Azure workbooks so that we have a better dashboard for CiscoDuo logs, and I've also helped edit, refine, and format documentation for various procedures within the department. I am also employed as a Sales Associate at Bath and Body Works Inc. where I have worked for the past 6 years to help support myself through university. 

When I'm not working to improve myself from an academic standpoint, there are a few hobbies of mine that I like to put time into. One of my hobbies is crocheting! I learned from my great-grandma and grandma when I was very young, and picked up the craft again during the pandemic. I create all sorts of plushies and tapestries that I sell on my Etsy shop. I also love to play video games, something that my dad and I bonded over when I was younger and it still connects us today. My current favorite titles are Marvel Snap, Overwatch 2, and A Little to the Left. I also enjoy going to the gym and doing some weight training, which gives my fingers and mind a break from coding, crocheting, or playing video games.
